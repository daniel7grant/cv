                        I've started writing JavaScript even before ES6 and React become popular, writing a whole client-side application entirely with jQuery and XHR.
                        This taught me a lot about technologies that build up the web, but it wasn't very clean, with many intermingling parts.

                        After joining DONE., I began working on interactive frontends in React, which taught me a lot about organization of code and state-driven applications.
                        Even after having a little experience with Vue.js, I am still most comfortable while writing JSX.

                        After working with PHP for a long time, writing my first Node.js backend really blew my mind. The speed and 
                        the simplicity of writing simple callback functions as routes made Express instantly my favourite backend library.

                        to work on any scale, adding TypeScript for typing, OpenAPI for documentation and Jest for testing. 
                        These tools made me as productive as ever to quickly and reliably build APIs.

                        I worked with HTML and CSS for more than I could remember. I started with the usual
                        middle-school treatment, creating my best 90's website impression. Soon I became familiar with CSS
                        and have been fascinated by the shadows, gradients, and animations. I learnt many of the quirks of the CSS
                        and built websites out of my own designs in university.

                        When I started working at DONE., the company's main profile was custom-designed WordPress, and it really
                        kicked my sitebuilding experience into overdrive. I learnt to build massive websites from Figma very quickly,
                        keeping it compatible with Wordpress's modifiable building blocks. Speeding through websites made me
                        learn a lot about both building and design.

                        Like many people in backend development, I started my path with putting some PHP files
                        on a shared hosting server via FTP. Unaware of frameworks and packages, I hacked together a
                        whole application with my own authentication and session management.

                        While I recognize the great ecosystem of PHP, it probably wouldn't be my first choice for a new project.

                        and PostgreSQL (great extensibility, for example PostGIS). I also have experience with NoSQL databases, mainly with Redis

                        I started my DevOps career with managing a bunch of web servers scattered around shared hosting and separate VMs.
                        Back these days, I yearned for a better way to handle a lot of similar hosts, then Docker entered.

                        Docker really made me fall in love with containerization: I turned dozens of services into minimal Alpine-based
                        Docker images. These include WordPress, Laravel, OpenLDAP, Bind DNS, and replicated MariaDB. In the span of a few years
                        we turned the KTK infrastructure from undocumented VMs to mostly containerized.

                        Docker is great, but it is lacking in orchestrating multiple containers (even with Docker-compose), so recently

                        most of my new services with Helm and ArgoCD.

                        Throughout most of my studies, I was confronted with C-family languages. I started with the incredibly performant
                        albeit primitive structure of C. After a few years, I came back as a Linux developer and realized the power behind
                        the simple abstractions of C. Writing complicated code really made me appreciate the expressiveness of C.

                        rough around the edges (crate structure, async story), I think it has the potential to be the most powerful language.
                        It is now my go-to language for small binaries, and I try to experiment with its other uses (e.g. web server).

                        I always preferred self-hosting to the cloud, but especially for Kubernetes (and databases), it is very tough
                        to do it right. This is the reason we started getting into the cloud, firstly to AWS EKS and Azure AKS. These are
                        very robust with great features like load balancing and autoscaling. I learnt tons with these technologies.

                        Since then, we expanded our cloud operations to other services, like Elastic Beanstalk and RDS for simpler workloads.
                        For these, I prefer to use Terraform to deploy them as quickly and safely as I can.

                    <p>
                        When I first got into Linux, I wanted to be able to handle our LAMP stack more efficiently.
                        At first I just used scp to copy files, then I started using vim over ssh to quickly edit some files,
                        and got more and more used to the Linux terminal. Now Linux is the operating system of all of my computers,
                        and I fell in love with open source.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The thing I really liked about the Linux shell, is both the simplicity and the power it enables.
                        I enjoy writing my quick-and-dirty one-liners and shell scripts, and I learnt to automate
                        every part of my workflow. Now I use Ansible to install and set up my desktop and servers,
                        and use GitLab or Bitbucket pipelines to automate my deployments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am very thankful for Linux because it started me on the way of open source and taught me
                        to always look behind the curtain, and understand things as deeply as I can.
